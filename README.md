# Installation
here are the simple steps to be able to select this color scheme : 

- Create directory with `mkdir ~/.config/qterminal.org/color-schemes`
- Copy the `.colorscheme` file in the new folder with `cp Ayu-Dark.colorscheme ~/.config/qterminal.org/color-schemes/`
- Select the newly added color scheme in QTerminal's preference menu, under File -> Preferences...
